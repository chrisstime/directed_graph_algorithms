# Algorithms on a Directed Graph

Algorithms: 
* Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm (not using a priority queue).
* Tarjan's algorithm for finding strongly connected components.
* Modified Depth First Search to find weakly connected components.
* Kahn's algorithm for topological sorting:
  * to find DAGs.
  * to find Hamiltonian DAGs.
